I. This program was built on macOS Catalina and tested on linux.student.cs environment

II. Things have been done:

1.Implemented the sender program
	step 1: Read parameter from required command-line interface.
	step 2: Create the socket.
	step 3: Open that file
	step 4:	Calculate how many messages will be sent
	step 5: Send "WILL SEND x MESSAGES" to the receiver, x is the number of messages
	* This message won't be counted
	step 6: Send the file to the receiver
	step 7: Print "Sent x messages, y bytes."
	step 8: Close the socket
	
2.Implemented the receiver program
	step 1: Read parameter from required command-line interface.
	step 2: Crate the socket.
	step 3: Print the port number, and save the port number into file "port".
	step 4: Receive the message from the sender and write them into the file.
	* Will start a timeout that starts at the arrival of the 1st message except "WILL SEND x MESSAGES" (This message won't be counted)
	step 5: Print "Received x messages, y bytes."

* The sender and receiver program exchange control information regarding the length of the file transfer by sending an extra message "WILL SEND x MESSAGES". 
  When the receiver receives x messages, it terminates immediately.

3. Makefile:
According to pizza @22, I submit a Makefile with "all" and "clean" as empty targets, and executable files in the .zip

III. Things haven't been done:
None

IV. Experiments:
1.Report whether you observe any losses.
I observe losses especially when the size of file-to-be-sent is over 1MB.

2.Devise and document two test runs that demonstrate that your receiver program satisﬁes the requirements of 
a) immediately terminating after receiving the last message:
When sending a file of 4096bytes, it terminate immediately after it receives all messages.

y672huan@ubuntu1804-004:~/cs656/UDP$ ./sender localhost 8000 100 file4096
Sent 41 messages, 4096bytes.

y672huan@ubuntu1804-004:~/cs656/UDP$ time ./receiver /dev/null 10000
Port:  8000
Received  41  messages,  4096  bytes.

user	0m0.049s
sys	0m0.004s

b) terminating after the timeout expires, if the file transfer is not completed.
When sending a file of 1MB, it terminates after the timeout expires

y672huan@ubuntu1804-004:~/cs656/UDP$ ./sender localhost 8000 100 file1mb
Sent 10486 messages, 1048576bytes.

y672huan@ubuntu1804-004:~/cs656/UDP$ time ./receiver /dev/null 10000
Port:  8000
Error: time out.
Received  7243  messages,  724276  bytes.

real	0m15.683s
user	0m0.077s
sys	0m0.020s

3.Find parameter combinations that report a 'sys' time of at least 0.050s.
A) When the payload decreases, the 'sys' time will increase
y672huan@ubuntu1804-004:~/cs656/UDP$ time ./sender localhost 8000 1 file8192
Sent 8193 messages, 8192bytes.

real	0m0.098s
user	0m0.035s
sys	0m0.063s

B) When the size of file-to-be-sent increases, the 'sys' time will increase 
y672huan@ubuntu1804-004:~/cs656/UDP$ time ./sender localhost 8000 100 file1mb
Sent 10486 messages, 1048576bytes.

real	0m0.123s
user	0m0.063s
sys	0m0.059s

C) Conclusion:
With file size increasing or payload size decreasing, the number of messages will increase, which triggers the 'sys' time increases.
