This program was built on macOS Catalina and tested on linux.student.cs environment

Things have been done:

1.Implemented the sender program
	step 1: Wait for the command-line input. 
	step 2: Create the socket.
	step 3: Open that file
	step 4:	Calculate how many messages will be sent
	step 5: Send "WILL SEND x MESSAGES" to the receiver, x is the number of messages
	* This message won't be counted
	step 6: Send the file to the receiver
	step 7: Print "Sent x messages, y bytes."
	step 8: Close the socket
	
2.Implemented the receiver program
	step 1: Wait for the command-line input. 
	step 2: Crate the socket.
	step 3: Print the port number, and save the port number into file "port".
	step 4: Receive the message from the sender and write them into the file.
	* Will start a timeout that starts at the arrival of the 1st message except "WILL SEND x MESSAGES" (This message won't be counted)
	step 5: Print "Received x messages, y bytes."

* The sender and receiver program exchange control information regarding the length of the file transfer by sending an extra message "WILL SEND x MESSAGES". When the receiver receives x messages, it terminates immediately.
